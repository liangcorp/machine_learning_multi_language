# Machine Learning formulas implemented in Rust

Linear regression has been completed.
Gradient descent works with ex1data1 as it is.
It won't work well with feature scaling after scaling the features with mean normalization.

Work had been moved to its own [repo](https://github.com/liangcorp/machine_learning_rust)
