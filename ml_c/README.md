# Machine Learning formulas implemented in C

This is an exercise in C programming language.
I recommend a professional library for production use.
Make sure to copy the command in `env.sh` and run in the shell before running main.

Code has been moved to its own [repo](https://github.com/liangcorp/machine_learning_c)
